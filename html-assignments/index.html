        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Before I took the IMD program, I graduated from the Electrical Engineering program at Algonquin. The program made me feel unhappy because It’s something I didn’t see myself doing in the future. When I saw the IMD program, I believe I would enjoy learning and see myself having a career with this program.</p>
        <p>I enjoy going out with friends and eating at different restaurants. If I were to recommend a place to eat, it would be Gyubee Japanese Grill in Byward Market. Because they have a variety of menu items and it’s a great place to gather your friends to eat and socialize at.</p>
