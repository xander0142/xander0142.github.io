MTM6201 - Web Dev II - Portfolio
All pictures taken are from Alexander Pham



Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes?

The challenges that I have encountered during this development is having my own camera. I would always would have to rent a camera at Algonquin, but at least I managed to get to take photos and complete assignments for my photography class.

What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?

I've learned that they're alot of features I can add to my web portfolio and 
it is never over to make improvements over time to continue to catch the viewer's attention.
When making the website, I want to show a friendly and simple design that can easily be navigated through by the user. 
Hopefully in the future I can use what I learn and apply it to a workplace or start Pham Photography as a running service.
